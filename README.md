### Reinforcement Learning ‚Äì Implementations & Notes

This repository contains my personal study notes and implementations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts and algorithms.
Most of the material is based on the classic textbook:

## üìñ Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton & Barto

and complementary resources such as Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning by Miguel Morales.

The purpose of this repo is to:

Practice RL algorithms through implementation

Keep organized notes for future reference

Share reproducible examples for learners interested in RL
